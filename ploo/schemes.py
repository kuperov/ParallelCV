    This class contains a set of prediction coordinates as a "jagged array" implemented
    using a jax array and an array of masks to apply to the predictions, with 1 meaning
    include and 0 meaning exclude. We took this approach because Alex couldn't work out
    how to dynamically slice the coordinate array within the inference loop, so we just
    perform a static number of predictions for each group, and filter out the ones that
    aren't needed.

    The coords array axes are:

      * axis0: fold number
      * axis1: deleted cases
      * axis2: case coordinates, wrt to log likelihood contribution array

    The masks array has shape coords.shape[:2], and is defined by code equivalent to:
