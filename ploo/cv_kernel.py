    """Create a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo transition kernel.

    Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is known to yield effective Markov
    transitions and has been a major empirical success, leading to an extensive
    use in probabilistic programming languages and libraries [1,2,3]_.

    HMC works by augmenting the state space in which the chain evolves with an
    auxiliary momentum :math:`p`. At each step of the chain we draw a momentum
    value from the `momentum_generator` function. We then use Hamilton's
    equations [4]_ to push the state forward; we then compute the new state's
    energy using the `kinetic_energy` function and `logpdf` (potential energy).
    While the hamiltonian dynamics is conservative, numerical integration can
    introduce some discrepancy; we perform a Metropolis acceptance test to
    compensate for integration errors after having flipped the new state's
    momentum to make the transition reversible.

    I encourage anyone interested in the theoretical underpinning of the method
    to read Michael Betancourts' excellent introduction [3]_ and his more
    technical paper [5]_ on the geometric foundations of the method.

    This implementation is very general and should accomodate most variations
    on the method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    proposal_generator:
        The function used to propose a new state for the chain. For vanilla HMC this
        function integrates the trajectory over many steps, but gets more involved
        with other algorithms such as empirical and dynamical HMC.
    momentum_generator:
        A function that returns a new value for the momentum when called.
    kinetic_energy:
        A function that computes the current state's kinetic energy.
    divergence_threshold:
        The maximum difference in energy between the initial and final state
        after which we consider the transition to be divergent.

    Returns
    -------
    A kernel that moves the chain by one step when called.
