pcv: Convergence diagnostic for parallel MCMC
=============================================

This repo implements an online convergence diagnostic (Rhat) on a GPU. It enables brute force cross-validation and posterior stacking with parallel processing.

This branch contains code for an approximate sigmoidal transform. We won't bother with this in the paper, but this branch preserves the code for the future.

Setting up
----------

You'll need python â‰¥ 3.7. Alex uses CPython 3.10, although it is probably easiest to use Anaconda. YMMV.

On a reasonable OS you should be able to create the virtual environment that contains runtime and development dependencies with:

    git clone git@github.com:kuperov/ParallelCV.git
    cd ParallelCV
    make config

If you don't already have a python development environment you prefer, VSCode is free and has a shallow learning curve.
