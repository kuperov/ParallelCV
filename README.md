ploo: Parallel Brute Force LOO-CV
=================================

This is an experiment to try and implement LOO-CV with parallel processing on a GPU.

Setting up
----------

You'll need python â‰¥ 3.7. It's probably easiest to use Anaconda but YMMV.

On a reasonable OS you should be able to create the virtual environment that contains runtime and development dependencies with:

    make venv

If you must run Windows, use WSL.

Check everything is working by running the unit tests:

    make test

Hint: at the time of writing, everything is not working.

Roadmap has been moved to [Github issues](https://github.com/kuperov/ploo/labels/enhancement)
